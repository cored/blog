The Well-Grounded Software Engineer project aims to identify the timeless practices for us Software Engineers to follow to become more effective at our jobs.

The content will be mostly research around topics like Software Architecture, Leadership, Agile methodologies, Productivity, Psychology, Test-Driven Development, Management, and how those topics relate to one another.

The end goal is to seek transformation through collecting and processing information around everything related to the field of Software Engineering.

Software Engineering is about everything else but computers. We practitioners of the field need to broaden our horizons by exposing ourselves to ideas outside of computers.

We are building software for human beings that interact and perceive the world through a different lens. Understanding different perspective implies having a different set of skills.

> As a developer and educator, I apply this approach to integrate other areas of knowledge into my work, including fields like literature, history, and art. For example, if you look closely at the Learn Enough tutorials, youâ€™ll find frequent references to Greek mythology, Roman history, and English literature. I think developing an appreciation of that broader perspective is an important part of a technical education. by *Michael Harlt - RubyonRails Tutorial*

It is not that I am already a Well-Grounded Software Engineer but an aspiring one.
